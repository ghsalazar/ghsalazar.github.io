Welcome to my little homestead on the web. I teach Control of
Electrical Machines and Digital Signal Processors to students of
[Mechatronic Engineering](https://www.upiita.ipn.mx) at the [Instituto
Polit√©cnico Nacional](https://www.ipn.mx). Here, you will find my
writings about Mechatronics, Cybernetics and other related fields.

I also develop software, with special emphasis on control and
automation of mechatronic systems. You can find some of the software
that I have developed in my repositories at
[GitHub](https://github.com/ghsalazar) and
[MBED](https://os.mbed.com/users/ghsalazar).
